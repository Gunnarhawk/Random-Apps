# Random-Apps
This is where all of my random applications will go

Random Password Generator:
This program generates a random password out of most valid characters
It will allow the user to specify a length

Get Computer Info:
This was mainly used when I was working the helpdesk at Texas A&M University, it would allow me to quickly grab a list of applications, the computer's ip and mac address and a lot of other useful information about the computer and store it on a flash drive

Key Logger:
This was used to log a specific key and see if I was holding it for a certain ammount of time, the context is a big too specific to say

Speech Recognition:
This was a test on the Windows speech recognition built into the OS, I have to say, it is not great
My end goal for this program was to be able to ask the computer to do specific commands for me, but I gave up do to the lack of accuracy that I can do nothing about
